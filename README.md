# ISOLA

Each round there is this sequence of actions: -Move your pawn a single square in any direction (up, down, left, right, and diagonals), and -After moving the pawn, place a black square in any square still available on the board

The player who can no longer move his pawn loses.

you have 3 modes, one is for playing with 2 players and one is for playing as a cavalier, that is to say that the pawns can only move as a cavalier (chess) and the last one is for you to face the computer.
